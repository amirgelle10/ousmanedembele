<p>Whether you love him or you hate him, there's no debating the fact that LeBron James is one of the most physically gifted athletes to ever grace the game of basketball. Aside from the fact that he's bigger than most NFL linebackers (6'8'', 250 lbs.) and that he can play any position on the court with ease, what makes him such a special player is the fact that he plays the game with such a high basketball I.Q. and court awareness." In reality, LeBron James is like no other player we've seen before. However, not everyone seems to think so.</p>
