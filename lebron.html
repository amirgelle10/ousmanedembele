<p>Since 2015, LeBron has scored 13,739 regular-season points, or more than Hall of Famers Dave Cowens, Rudy Tomjanovich and Paul Westphal did in their careers; passed for 4,119 assists, or more than Hall of Fame guards JoJo White, Earl Monroe and Pete Maravich in their careers, and James grabbed 4,165 rebounds, or more than Hall of Famers Ralph Sampson and Chris Mullin in their careers.</p>

<p>Jamesâ€™ teams in Cleveland and Los Angeles have appeared in another 100 playoff games, or more than the career totals for Hall of Famers Elvin Hayes, Dave DeBusschere and Bob McAdoo. They have reached another four NBA Finals series and won two championships, which is more than Hall of Famers Dominique Wilkins, Charles Barkley and Dave Bing achieved.</p>
